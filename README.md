This repository is dedicated to analysis of TCR repertoires in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. 
It accompanies the chapter 'TCR repertoire analysis for anticancer immunotherapy' in the Molecular and Cellular Biology handbook.

This repository contains several files including:
- The raw data, derived from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8561238/
- Jupyter notebook tutorials for each part of the analysis
- The results of the analysis: processed data, clustering results and figures generated during the process.
